### Objective
Identify data drift between training (reference) data and live (current) data.

### Tools Used
- Python 3.7
- Pandas
- Evidently (v0.4.9)

### Steps
1. Created reference and current datasets
2. Detected feature-wise and dataset drift
3. Generated interactive HTML report

### Output
- `reports/drift_report.html`

### Notes
Evidently v0.4.9 was used for Python 3.7 compatibility.
