# Day 13 – Model Improvement & Comparison

## 📌 Objective
Improve model performance by training an advanced algorithm and comparing it with the baseline Linear Regression model.

---

## 🧠 Overview
In this phase, a **Random Forest Regressor** is introduced to capture non-linear patterns in the data.  
Both models are evaluated and compared to identify the better-performing model.

---

## 🤖 Models Used
- Linear Regression (Baseline)
- Random Forest Regressor (Improved)

---

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
- Loaded the processed dataset  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained Linear Regression model  
- Trained Random Forest Regressor  
- Evaluated both models using MSE and R² Score  
- Compared model performance  
- Saved the best-performing model  

---

## 📊 Model Comparison Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R² Score**

Random Forest performed better by learning complex, non-linear relationships in the dataset.
