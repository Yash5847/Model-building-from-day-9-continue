🚀MLOps Learning Journey🚀 
(Day 9 to Day 22)

Project Overview
This repository contains my MLOps learning journey from Day 9 to Day 22.
Each day contains a practical task/project focused on real-world MLOps concepts.
The goal is to learn end-to-end ML lifecycle: training, deployment, monitoring, and automation.

--------------------------------------------------

Repository Structure
The repo is organized into day-wise folders:

- Day9_Model_Building
- Day10_Model_Evaluation_Tuning
- Day11_Model_Deployment
- Day12_Model_Evaluation
- Day13_model_improvement
- Day14_Hyperparameter_tuning
- day15_model_inference
- Day16_FastAPI_
- Day17_Model_Monitoring_Prediction_Logging
- Day18_Model_Monitoring
- Day19_Data_Drift_Detection
- day20_model_deployment
- Day21_Model_Deployment
- Day22_Model_Retraining_Automation

Each folder contains the relevant code, datasets, and notes for that day.
